/*! Access to networking hardware.

The `phy` module deals with the *network devices*. It provides a trait
for transmitting and receiving frames, [Device](trait.Device.html)
and implementations of it:

  * the [_loopback_](struct.Loopback.html), for zero dependency testing;
  * _middleware_ [Tracer](struct.Tracer.html) and
    [FaultInjector](struct.FaultInjector.html), to facilitate debugging;
  * _adapters_ [RawSocket](struct.RawSocket.html) and
    [TunTapInterface](struct.TunTapInterface.html), to transmit and receive frames
    on the host OS.

/// Metadata associated to a packet.
///
/// The packet metadata is a set of attributes associated to network packets
/// as they travel up or down the stack. The metadata is get/set by the
/// [`Device`] implementations or by the user when sending/receiving packets from a
/// socket.
///
/// Metadata fields are enabled via Cargo features. If no field is enabled, this
/// struct becomes zero-sized, which allows the compiler to optimize it out as if
/// the packet metadata mechanism didn't exist at all.
///
/// Currently only UDP sockets allow setting/retrieving packet metadata. The metadata
/// for packets emitted with other sockets will be all default values.
///
/// This struct is marked as `#[non_exhaustive]`. This means it is not possible to
/// create it directly by specifying all fields. You have to instead create it with
/// default values and then set the fields you want. This makes adding metadata
/// fields a non-breaking change.

/// let mut meta = smoltcp::phy::PacketMeta::default();
